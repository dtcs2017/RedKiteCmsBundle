UPGRATE FROM 1.1.x RC3
AlphaLemon CMS RC4 introduces a new table in the database, so it must be updated to get
this new entity.

The upgrade process is really easy. After you upgraded you AlphaLemon CMS application,
just open a terminal and run the following commands:

    ./php app/console --env=alcms alphalemon:update-to-1-1-x-RC4 "[DSN]"

Between double quotes add your dsn. If you don't remember it, open the app/config/config_alcms.yml
file and read it from the Propel's configuration:

    propel:
        path:       "%kernel.root_dir%/../vendor/propel/propel1"
        phing_path: "%kernel.root_dir%/../vendor/phing/phing"

        dbal:
            driver:               mysql
            user:                 root
            password:             
            dsn:                  mysql:host=localhost;port=3306;dbname=alphalemon
