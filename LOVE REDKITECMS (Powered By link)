Love RedKite CMS
================

RedKite CMS automatically adds a "Powered By RedKite CMS" link to each page of the 
website, when it is deployed.

This is an important advertise to help us to spread the world about RedKite CMS, so, 
if you are satisfied with this application, we will be glad if you could give some 
love to RedKite CMS, leaving this adverise active.

Integration with your website
-----------------------------
You can perfectly integrate the RedKite CMS link into your website adding a new
slot to your base template to render it in all the website's pages as follows:

    {% block redkitecms_love %}
        {# BEGIN-SLOT
            name: redkitecms_love
            repeated: site
            htmlContent: |
                <a href="http://redkite-labs.com">Powered by RedKite CMS</a>
        END-SLOT #}
        {{ renderSlot('redkitecms_love') }}
    {% endblock %}   

Avoid rendering the "Powered by link"
-------------------------------------
You might choose to avoid rendering this link, but you must expressly say that you
don't love RedKite CMS - yes, we're trying to make you feel guilty ;-)

Simply open the config_rkcms.yml and add the following configuration under the red_kite_cms
key:

    red_kit_cms:
        [...]
        love: no

Be careful, you have to say exactly no!
