LOVE ALPHALEMONCMS
Since AlphaLemon 1.0.0 stable a "Powered By RedKiteCms" link is automatically added
to each page of the website, when it is deployed.

This is the only advertise to spread the world about RedKiteCms, so if you are
satisfied with this application, we will be glad if you could give some love to
AlphaLemon Cms, giving us a link back.

Integration with your website
-----------------------------
You can perfecttly integrate the RedKiteCms link into your website adding a new
slot to your base template to render it in all the website's pages as follows:

    {% block alphalemon_love %}
        {# BEGIN-SLOT
            name: alphalemon_love
            repeated: site
            htmlContent: |
                <a href="http://alphalemon.com">Powered by RedKiteCms</a>
        END-SLOT #}
        {{ renderSlot('alphalemon_love') }}
    {% endblock %}   

Avoid rendering the "Powered by link"
-------------------------------------
You might choose to avoid rendering this link, but you must expressly say that you
don't love RedKiteCms - yes, we're trying to make you feel guilty ;-) -

Simply open the config_alcms.yml and add the following configuration under the alphalemon
key:

    alphalemon:
        [...]
        love: no

Be careful, you have to say exactly no!
