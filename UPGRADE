UPGRADE FROM AlphaLemon CMS PR5
The AlContent table has been renamed to AlBlock. To port this change to your database, open the console and launch the following command:

    app/console --env=alcms alphalemon:update-db-to-PR6 [dsn]


UPGRADE FROM AlphaLemon CMS PR4 or less
This new version has two more tables which must be added to your database. AlphaLemon provides a command that does this job for you.

Open the console and launch the following command:

    app/console --env=alcms alphalemon:update-db-to-PR5 [dsn]

Don't forget to provide the right [dns] for your environment


Upgrade a database which is not mysql
AlphaLemon just provides the queries for mysql database, so if you are using another one you must adapt the queries on your own:

    1. Move to /vendor/bundles/AlphaLemon/AlphaLemonCms/Resources/dbupdate
    2. Copy the mysql folder and name it as the driver you are using
    3. Enter that folder and fix the queries contained in the AlphaLemonCmsPr5.sql
    4. Launch the command providing the driver option. This one must be the same of the folder created at step2
