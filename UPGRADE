UPGRADE FROM AlphaLemon CMS PR6
This document explains how to upgrade your AlphaLemon CMS project from AlphaLemon PR6 or higher.

Backup
Before starting this operation, be sure to backup your database.

Upgrading
There are three tasks to run to upgrade your project, it depends on the version you are running out. it is not important
to know which version you are using, so, if you don't know, you may run all the tasks as follow:

    app/console --env=alcms alphalemon:update-to-pre-alpha [dsn]
    app/console --env=alcms alphalemon:update-to-pre-alpha-1 [dsn]
    app/console --env=alcms alphalemon:update-to-alpha [dsn]

Upgrade a database which is not mysql
AlphaLemon just provides the queries for mysql database, so if you are using another one you must adapt the queries on your own:

    1. Move to /vendor/bundles/AlphaLemon/AlphaLemonCms/Resources/dbupdate
    2. Copy the mysql folder and name it as the driver you are using
    3. Enter that folder and fix the queries for your database
    4. Launch the command providing the driver option. This one must be the same of the folder created at step2
