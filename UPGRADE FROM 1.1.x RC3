Upgrade from 1.1.x RC3
----------------------
This document explains in detail how to migrate from AlphaLemon CMS RC3 to RC4. If you
come from a the Beta4 release or older, read the paragraph at the end of this document.


Database backup
---------------
It's strongly suggested to backup your database before start with this upgrade. You can
use a tool like phpmyadmin for that.


Composer dependencies [IMPORTANT]
---------------------------------
Since Release Candidate 4, AlphaLemon CMS does not require anymore the editor for hypertext
blocks, neither the default theme, so you must require them explicitely in the main 
application's composer.json file, if you need them:

    {
        [...]
        
        "require": {        
            
            [...]
            
            "alphalemon/app-tinymce-block-bundle": "dev-master",
            "alphalemon/bootbusiness-theme-bundle": "dev-master",
        },
    }
    
Be careful and sure to add the "alphalemon/app-tinymce-block-bundle" requirement, if 
you do not use another bundle which manages hypertext blocks.

If you want to use the CKEditor instead of the TinyMCE editor, just require the 
alphalemon/app-ckeditor-block-bundle instead of alphalemon/app-tinymce-block-bundle.


Update the database
-------------------
AlphaLemon CMS RC4 introduces a new table in the database, so it must be updated to get
this new entity.

The upgrade process is really easy. After you upgraded you AlphaLemon CMS application,
just open a terminal and run the following commands:

    ./php app/console --env=alcms alphalemon:update-to-1-1-x-RC4 "[DSN]"

Between double quotes add your dsn. If you don't remember it, open the app/config/config_alcms.yml
file and read it from the Propel's configuration:

    propel:
        path:       "%kernel.root_dir%/../vendor/propel/propel1"
        phing_path: "%kernel.root_dir%/../vendor/phing/phing"

        dbal:
            driver:               mysql
            user:                 root
            password:             
            dsn:                  mysql:host=localhost;port=3306;dbname=alphalemon


Upgrade from AlphaLemon CMS Beta4 or older
------------------------------------------
If you need to upgrade from an AlphaLemon CMS 1.1.x Beta4 version, you must upgrade to
AlphaLemon CMS RC3 and do all the required upgrades. After that you will be able to 
upgrade to AlphaLemon CMS RC4, as explained in this documentation.
