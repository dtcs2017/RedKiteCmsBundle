# AlphaLemon CMS User Manual (Part 2)
In this chapter you will learn how to manage languages, pages, themes and how to deploy your website.

# Pages
First of all, we must understand how a page is defined in the CMS structure. It is identified by an unique internal name you must provide, and has attached a template. 

In addiction, it has a set of attributes, used by the search engines to categorize your site. Those attributes are:

- Permalink
- Title
- Description
- Keywords

Title, description and keywords are the metatags, some hidden elements that belongs teh page which are not displayed on the webpage itself, and used by search engines to indicize the site. The permalink is a static permanent link that identifies the page outside the site.

Those attributes are different for each language, this means that a page has a link for one language and annother one for a different language. For example, you may have a page named contacts which might have a permalink **contact-us** for the English version and another permalink **contattaci** for the Italian page.

## Add a new page

# Themes
To add a new theme, you have to open the right panel by clicking the Theme command on the main toolbar. This panel is divided in two columns: the left one displays the current active theme, the right column displays all the available themes and on the bottom, there is the Upload button that lets you upload new themes for your website.

## Add a theme
A theme is always packed into a zip file, please refer to this [dedicated chapter](add-a-custom-theme-to-alphalemon-cms) to learn how to build your own theme so to add a new theme you have to upload that zip file by choosing it from your hard disk. 

Sometimes you might want to copy the theme in the theme's folder without using the uploader, for example, when you are designing a new theme so you are working directly on the theme's folder, in this case the theme won't be usable until you manually add it to the CMS. This step is done by clicking the **Add theme** link placed under it.

## Activate a theme
Activating the means to promote the theme as the one used on the website, so to activate it, you just click the **Activate** link placed under the theme you want to promote.
