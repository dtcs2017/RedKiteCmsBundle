The stable release introduces the stage environment. To enable it in a previous release
take this steps:

1. Copy the stage.php and stage_dev.php files from vendor/alphalemon/theme-engine-bundle/AlphaLemon/ThemeEngineBundle/Resources/environments/frontcontrollers
to application's web folder
2. Under the app/config folder, create the config_stage.yml file and add the following code:

    imports:
        - { resource: config.yml }

    framework:
        router:   { resource: "%kernel.root_dir%/config/routing_stage.yml" }

3. Under the app/config folder, create the config_stage_dev.yml file and add the following code:

    imports:
        - { resource: config_dev.yml }

    framework:
        router:   { resource: "%kernel.root_dir%/config/routing_stage_dev.yml" }

4. Under the app/config folder, create the routing_stage.yml file and add the following code:

    _AcmeWebSiteBundleStage:
        resource: "@AcmeWebSiteBundle/Resources/config/site_routing_stage.yml"

5. Under the app/config folder, create the routing_stage_dev.yml file and add the following code:

    _stage_prod:
        resource: routing_stage.yml

    _stage_dev:
        resource: routing_dev.yml
